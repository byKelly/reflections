When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work locally?

If there is a need for more input or ideas in how to fix a problem, having a remote repository allows
for a collaboration on the project.  It lets several people to focus on the problem at hand
and bounce ideas off of each other.  The work or progress can be viewed by many individuals 
at once and that creates more ample opportunity for consultation on the whole project(s).


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It is good to pull changes manually.  The act of doing so helps reinforce the event
and helps trigger the memory of that event later as a point of reference.  Also,
there might be moments when you do not want a change recorded that Git would
automatically save in the process of keeping things up-to-date.
